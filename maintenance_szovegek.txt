oil:
Check your motorcycle’s engine oil level regularly to ensure proper performance and engine longevity. Place the bike on a level surface and use either the sight glass or dipstick to confirm the oil level is between the minimum and maximum marks. If necessary, add the manufacturer-recommended oil carefully without overfilling. 

chain:
Regular motorcycle chain maintenance is essential for smooth power delivery and long component life. Clean the chain regularly using a suitable chain cleaner and a soft brush to remove dirt and old lubricant. After cleaning and drying, apply a high-quality chain lubricant evenly along the entire length of the chain. Make sure to adjust the chain tension according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Proper lubrication and adjustment help reduce wear, improve performance, and extend the life of the chain and sprockets. 

fluids:
Regularly checking other essential fluids, such as coolant and brake fluid, is crucial for safe and reliable motorcycle operation. The coolant helps maintain proper engine temperature and prevents overheating; always check the level in the expansion tank when the engine is cold and ensure it is between the minimum and maximum marks. Use only the coolant type recommended by the manufacturer. Brake fluid is vital for effective braking performance. Check the fluid level in the brake fluid reservoir and make sure it remains within the indicated range. If the level is low or the fluid appears dark or contaminated, it should be replaced according to the manufacturer’s service intervals. 

tires:
Regular inspection of your motorcycle’s wheels is essential for safety and optimal performance. Check the tire pressure frequently and adjust it according to the manufacturer’s recommended values. Inspect the tires for uneven wear, cracks, cuts, or embedded objects that could cause damage or loss of grip. Ensure that the tread depth is within legal and safe limits. Also, check that the wheels are properly aligned and that all axle nuts and fasteners are securely tightened.Regular inspection of your motorcycle’s wheels is essential for safety and optimal performance.

Also, check that the wheels are properly aligned and that all axle nuts and fasteners are securely tightened. 

handling:
Regular inspection of the handlebar and steering head bearings is essential for safe motorcycle handling. Check that the handlebar is securely mounted and does not move or twist independently of the front wheel. Turn the handlebar fully from left to right to ensure smooth and unrestricted movement without unusual noises or resistance. To inspect the steering head bearings, lift the front wheel off the ground and gently move the handlebar from side to side. The movement should be smooth, without tight spots or notches. Also, check for any play by pulling the front forks forward and backward; there should be no noticeable looseness. Properly adjusted and well-maintained steering components ensure precise control and riding stability.. 

brakes:
Regular brake inspection is crucial for motorcycle safety. Check both front and rear brakes for proper operation, ensuring the brake levers and pedals feel firm and responsive. Inspect brake pads for wear and replace them if they are below the manufacturer’s recommended thickness. Check brake discs for signs of warping, grooves, or damage. Finally, ensure the brake fluid level is within the correct range and that the fluid is clean; replace it according to the service schedule to maintain optimal braking performance.
