                Check your motorcycle’s engine oil level regularly to ensure
                proper performance and engine longevity. Place the bike on a
                level surface and use either the sight glass or dipstick to
                confirm the oil level is between the minimum and maximum marks.
                If necessary, add the manufacturer-recommended oil carefully
                without overfilling.

                Regular motorcycle chain maintenance is essential for smooth
                power delivery and long component life. Clean the chain
                regularly using a suitable chain cleaner and a soft brush to
                remove dirt and old lubricant. After cleaning and drying, apply
                a high-quality chain lubricant evenly along the entire length of
                the chain. Make sure to adjust the chain tension according to
                the manufacturer’s specifications. Proper lubrication and
                adjustment help reduce wear, improve performance, and extend the
                life of the chain and sprockets.

                Regularly checking other essential fluids, such as coolant and
                brake fluid, is crucial for safe and reliable motorcycle
                operation. The coolant helps maintain proper engine temperature
                and prevents overheating; always check the level in the
                expansion tank when the engine is cold and ensure it is between
                the minimum and maximum marks. Use only the coolant type
                recommended by the manufacturer. Brake fluid is vital for
                effective braking performance. Check the fluid level in the
                brake fluid reservoir and make sure it remains within the
                indicated range. If the level is low or the fluid appears dark
                or contaminated, it should be replaced according to the
                manufacturer’s service intervals.

                Regular inspection of your motorcycle’s wheels is essential for
                safety and optimal performance. Check the tire pressure
                frequently and adjust it according to the manufacturer’s
                recommended values. Inspect the tires for uneven wear, cracks,
                cuts, or embedded objects that could cause damage or loss of
                grip. Ensure that the tread depth is within legal and safe
                limits. Also, check that the wheels are properly aligned and
                that all axle nuts and fasteners are securely tightened.Regular

                Regular inspection of the handlebar and steering head bearings
                is essential for safe motorcycle handling. Check that the
                handlebar is securely mounted and does not move or twist
                independently of the front wheel. Turn the handlebar fully from
                left to right to ensure smooth and unrestricted movement without
                unusual noises or resistance. To inspect the steering head
                bearings, lift the front wheel off the ground and gently move
                the handlebar from side to side. The movement should be smooth,
                without tight spots or notches. Also, check for any play by
                pulling the front forks forward and backward; there should be no
                noticeable looseness. Properly adjusted and well-maintained
                steering components ensure precise control and riding
                stability..

                Regular brake inspection is crucial for motorcycle safety. Check
                both front and rear brakes for proper operation, ensuring the
                brake levers and pedals feel firm and responsive. Inspect brake
                pads for wear and replace them if they are below the
                manufacturer’s recommended thickness. Check brake discs for
                signs of warping, grooves, or damage. Finally, ensure the brake
                fluid level is within the correct range and that the fluid is
                clean; replace it according to the service schedule to maintain
                optimal braking performance.
